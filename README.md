# The Repository 

The intent of the Code Repository("README-Generator)was to create a application with the use of Node.js and JavaScript to have a automated way to generate a Readme File. The readme file was to include specific quesitons that where prompted when running the node js in the command line. 

The Readme Generator will ask the user, for their github username, their email address, Title of the Readme, usage, installation, Description etc. The Generator will also ask about the Licesnses used and badges will be applied based on the choices provided. 

For this challenge we were given starter code by the follwoing github account: https://github.com/Chasetopher/WeatherDashboard

## Installation

For this Repo the follwing Installation Instruction need to be used to test this project:

1.) Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to ensure you have Node.js working on your machine
2.) Clone the main branch repository for my github account
3.) Navigate to your download folder, or find the cloned repsitory. 
4.) Once you have setup a new folder in VS Code or another IDE of your choosing install the npn inquirer by typing "npm install inquirer" into the terminal. This should bring up a install in your terminal
5.)  Next step would be to type node index.js in your terminal, and the terminal will ask you the README Generator prompts, you will have to follow the prompts and all required fields will need to be answere, or the README will not generate. Once these are filled in, the terminal will show No Errors, Readme Generated
6. Readme was generated and should now be as a seperate tab in VS Code and can be found under the asset folder, in the project.
